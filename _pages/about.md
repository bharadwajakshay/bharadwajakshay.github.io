Iâ€™m Akshay Bharadwaj, a PhD candidate in Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary, specializing in computer vision, robotics, and photogrammetry.

My research focuses on developing multi-sensor fusion and SLAM systems, with applications in autonomous navigation, 3D reconstruction, and digital twins. I work extensively with photogrammetric self-calibration, sensor benchmarking, and deep learning approaches for multi-modal sensor alignment, achieving up to a 50% increase in accuracy and 10x improvements in reconstruction precision.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Science Engineering from Ohio University, where I built perception payloads for UAV navigation in structured environments. I also hold a B.E. in Medical Electronics from Visvesvaraya Technological University, India.

Alongside research, I have several years of teaching experience, including co-instructing courses on digital imaging, numerical methods, and programming, as well as guiding students in data analysis, embedded systems, and computer vision applications.

Professionally, I worked as a Software Engineer in Sensor Fusion at LocusLabs (acquired by Google), where I developed full-stack perception and mapping systems deployed in airports and malls worldwide. Earlier in my career, I was an Embedded Design Engineer at Redmount Consultancy Services, designing FPGA/DSP-based imaging solutions.

My work has been published in IEEE/ION conferences and journals, with contributions spanning UAV navigation, 3D vision, and medical imaging.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between theory and practice, designing algorithms that directly translate into robust, real-world systems.
