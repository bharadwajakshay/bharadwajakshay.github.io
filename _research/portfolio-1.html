                <p>My work focused on developing and deploying a small-UAS platform specifically designed for autonomous inspection in challenging, GPS-denied environments like maintenance tunnels. This project integrated multiple sensors and a custom navigation algorithm to ensure reliable operation in confined spaces.</p>

                <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
                    <li>Built a small-UAS platform for autonomous inspection, integrating LiDAR, vision, and thermal sensors via ROS for 3D mapping and heat-signature monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Developed a custom navigation algorithm that improved efficiency by 60% over existing methods and was optimized for real-time operation on a low-power onboard computer.</li>
                    <li>Performed multi-sensor calibration and fusion to enable reliable SLAM-based navigation and inspection in confined environments.</li>
                </ul>
